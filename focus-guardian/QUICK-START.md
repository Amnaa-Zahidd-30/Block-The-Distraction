## 🚫 What This App CAN'T Do (Yet)

❌ **Lock mobile apps** - Only works in web browser
❌ **Force you to work** - Requires your self-discipline
❌ **Block websites completely** - Shows reminder, doesn't prevent access
❌ **Save your tasks** - Resets when you close browser (for now)
❌ **Track you automatically** - You must check off tasks manually

**But it CAN:**
✅ Make you aware of distractions
✅ Give you accountability
✅ Track your daily progress
✅ Motivate you with messages
✅ Help build better habits
